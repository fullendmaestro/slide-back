# Slide Back: AI powered memory slider

![Slide Back Demo](public/slide-back.webp)

## Overview

Slide Back is a memory gallery and slideshow app designed to help users revisit their cherished memories using AI. The gallery organizes your media through an immersive experience. And the slider create a slide show of your memories focusing on returning the most relevant and accurate memories by leveraging advanced AI to surface moments that truly match your prompts.

## How it works

Slide Back uses AI to organize, describe, and retrieve your photos and videos, making it easy to rediscover meaningful moments. The app works in two main modes:

### Slide

Describe the memories you want to revisit using natural languageâ€”for example, "happy dinners with my family" or "vacations at the beach." Slide Back leverages AI-powered semantic search to surface your most relevant photos and videos, creating a personalized slideshow experience. After the initial search, a large language model (LLM) reviews and refines the results through a process called Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), ensuring your slideshow features only the most meaningful and accurate memories.

### Gallery

Upload your photos and videos to the gallery. AI automatically generates descriptions for your media, which are used for semantic search. You can also edit these descriptions to add your own keywords (e.g name of persons and places), thereby improving future search results and giving you more control over how your memories are found.

## UI UX

Slid back is developed mainly for desktop experience with context menu for performing quick actions. Howwever it will also works fine for mobile experience also.

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js, pnpm or npm, Git.
- [Google Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai), [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob), [Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/quickstart),

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fullendmaestro/slide-back
cd slide-back
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 3: Set up environment variables:

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example).

```bash
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token
```

### Step 4: Run database migrations:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

### Step 5 (Optional): Enable gemini pro model:

This project uses gemini flash by default, however, gemini pro model is more capable with vision capabilities. You can optionally enable gemini pro model by heading to `lib\ai\generateDescription.ts` and `lib\ai\embedding.ts` to uncomment the `model: google("gemini-1.5-pro-002"),` and comment `model: google("gemini-1.5-flash-002")`. This ensures better ai memory description and discovery

### Step 6: Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Notes

The vercel blob service used for this project only support 5mb maximum single file upload
