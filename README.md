# Slide Back: AI powered memory slider

![Slide Back Demo](public/slide-back.webp)

## Overview

Slide Back is a memory gallery and slideshow app designed to help users revisit their cherished memories using AI. The gallery organizes your media through an immersive experience. And the slider create a slide show of your memories focusing on returning the most accurate and meaningful memories by leveraging advanced AI to surface moments that truly match your prompts.

## How it works

Slide Back uses AI to organize, describe, and retrieve your photos and videos, making it easy to rediscover meaningful moments. The app works in two main modes:

### Slide

Describe the memories you want to revisit using natural languageâ€”for example, "happy dinners with my family" or "vacations at the beach." Slide Back leverages AI-powered semantic search to surface your most relevant photos and videos, creating a personalized slideshow experience. After the initial search, a large language model (LLM) reviews and refines the results through a process called Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), ensuring your slideshow features only the most meaningful and accurate memories.

### Gallery

Upload your photos and videos to the gallery. AI automatically generates descriptions for your media, which are used for semantic search. You can also edit these descriptions to add your own keywords (e.g name of persons and places), improving future search results and giving you more control over how your memories are found.

## UI UX

Slid back is developed mainly for desktop experience with context menu for performing actions. Howwever its will also works fine on mobile experience also.
